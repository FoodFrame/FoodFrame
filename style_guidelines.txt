Overall Look and Feel of Roomie
===============================

- Bright and calm.
- Clean and slimplistic
- Fluid
- Easy and intuitive navigation


Colours
========
For FoodFrame, we decided to go with light orange and brown as our main colours. This will give our website an elegant contrast and a clean and professional look. These colours will also contribute to the aesthetic feel of our organization's webiste:

- #F29849
- #602400
- #F8B474
- #3F1903

Iconography
===========
Our icons will be for the very most part in 2D. We decided to go for a simple, clean and elegant design for our website and thus, flat icons will be best for this look. They will also have a neutral color like black or white.


Typography
==========
We will be using Roboto from Google Fonts. We found that it matched the aesthetic for our website design.


Links
=====
We won't have simple anchor tag in our website. They will be embedded in list items that we create in the navbar and in the body of our website pages. This will allow us to give the website a more professional look.


Buttons
=======
Our buttons will have reasonably strong border-radius intensity and will either have a shade of brown or orange (matching the colours of our website)


Typography ( tweek it need changes)
==========
We will be using Roboto from Google Fonts.
